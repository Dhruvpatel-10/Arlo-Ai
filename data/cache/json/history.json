Here are a few facts that might raise an eyebrow or two.\n\nIn ancient Greece, brothels were actually considered public institutions, and they were even taxed. Because, you know, someone's gotta pay the bills.\n\nAncient Greek men loved a good gym session, but they didn't just work out for the sake of fitness - they also did it to show off their bodies to potential lovers.\n\nThe Greeks didn't just have a word for love - they had several. There was eros (romantic love), philia (friendship), storge (family love), and even agape (unconditional love).\n\nBut let's get to the really good stuff. In ancient Greece, it was considered perfectly normal for men to have relationships with younger men - in fact, it was even considered a rite of passage.\n\nGreek women, on the other hand, didn't have it so easy. They were expected to be chaste and faithful to their husbands, and any sign of infidelity could result in serious consequences.\n\nAncient Greek art often featured erotic scenes, and we're not just talking about subtle hints of passion - we're talking full-on nudity and graphic sex.\n\nIn ancient Greece, sex was considered a form of spiritual practice - the idea being that the union of two bodies could bring the participants closer to the divine.\n\nBut it wasn't all about the spiritual benefits - the Greeks also believed that sex was"

He was said to have had affairs with his sisters, and even made his horse a consul (but we're not sure if that was a romantic relationship or not).\n\nThe Romans loved a good orgy, and they didn't just save them for special occasions. In fact, they had entire festivals dedicated to Bacchus, the god of wine and ecstasy, where participants would engage in all sorts of debauched activities.\n\nRoman women, unlike their Greek counterparts, had a bit more freedom when it came to sex. They could even own property, and some even became famous for their, ahem, \"exploits\".\n\nThe Roman forum was a hotbed of prostitution, with brothels and sex workers catering to the needs of sailors, soldiers, and even senators.\n\nOne of the most infamous Roman emperors, Nero, was known for his love of cross-dressing and role-playing. He even had a special wedding ceremony with one of his male lovers, where he played the bride.\n\nRoman art often featured erotic scenes, and we're not just talking about innocent nudes. We're talking full-on, graphic depictions of sex acts that would make even the most seasoned adult film star blush.\n\nThe Roman poet Ovid wrote extensively about"

It features detailed illustrations and instructions on everything from foreplay to, ahem, \"advanced\" techniques.\n\nIn ancient India, sex was considered a sacred act, and the union of two bodies was seen as a way to connect with the divine. This led to the development of tantric sex, which emphasized the spiritual aspects of sex.\n\nThe Hindu god Krishna was known for his many loves and conquests, and his relationship with the gopis (cowherd girls) is still celebrated in Indian literature and art today.\n\nThe ancient Indian city of Khajuraho was famous for its erotic temples, which featured intricate carvings and sculptures of people in various, ahem, \"compromising\" positions.\n\nThe Indian concept of \" Ardhanarishvara\" - a being that is half-male and half-female - was seen as the ultimate symbol of union and balance between the sexes.\n\nIn ancient India, prostitution was a recognized profession, and courtesans were often celebrated for their beauty, wit, and charm.\n\nThe ancient Indian text, the Mahabharata, features a story about the god Shiva, who is said to have had an affair with a woman named Moh"
